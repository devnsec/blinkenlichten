Good morning Mr. Astley,

During our standard 24/7 monitoring of Gruber HQ, we noticed they upgraded their server room lock late last night. My team worked through the night and just a moment ago we were able to obtain the schemetic of the lock. I give you my word Mr. Astley: we will not sleep until we have reverse engineered the PIN code.

Semper fi,

Richard Steele
Head of Competitor Intelligence
